# Interactive Map of the World
A SVG of the world was grabbed to create an interactive map that displays information on the country selected. Data was aquired from the World bank API found at https://www.worldbank.org/en/home and unpacked into the data of interest to be displayed for the project. 
The program has been modularized with Angular 17 so that components and services of the program can be saved for future use in other projects or improved with additional features.
